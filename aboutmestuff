Blog in progress.

I’m an undergraduate at MIT studying Brain & Cognitive Science (Course 9). I’m especially interested in using BCS as a framework to study linguistics, computer science and education.

When I’m not struggling through problem sets or sleeping, I’m a first responder, a chef, and a dreamer. I like walking unfrequented paths and getting lost in the woods. I love to chat with people who push me to consider questions I’ve never thought to ask (especially over a good coffee). Sometimes I take life too seriously, but I’m learning to embrace its uncertainty and spontenaity.
